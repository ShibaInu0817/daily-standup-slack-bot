## 💭 Prevent Sleeping (Optional)

Render free tier sleeps after 15 minutes. Prevent this using [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com):

1. Add a new HTTP monitor
2. Ping `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/` every 5 minutes

---

## 🧪 Try It Out!

1. In Slack, type `/standup-config`
2. Set your standup time, days, and report channel
3. Configure reminder and timeout settings
4. You'll get a reminder 30 minutes before your scheduled standup time
5. You'll get DM'd at the scheduled time to answer standup questions
6. Answers will be posted in the configured channel 🎉
7. If you don't respond within the timeout period, your standup session will be automatically closed

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Reminders
* When enabled, users receive a DM 30 minutes before their scheduled standup
* The reminder includes a preview of the questions that will be asked
* Users can acknowledge the reminder with a 👍 reaction

### Session Timeouts
* When enabled, incomplete standup sessions will timeout after a configured period (default: 2 hours)
* Users will receive a notification when their session times out
* This prevents users from getting stuck in the standup flow if they miss a question

---

## 🧼 Troubleshooting

* **dispatch\_failed**: Your Render app might be asleep or URL is wrong.
* **missing\_scope**: You forgot to add required permissions.
* **timeout**: Slack expects a fast response. Always `res.send()` immediately.
* **Reminders not working**: Check that your bot has the `chat:write` permission and that reminders are enabled in the configuration.
* **Timeout not working**: Make sure timeouts are enabled and the timeout duration is set correctly.

## Fix for "Sending messages to this app has been turned off"

If you're seeing this error when trying to message the bot directly, you need to configure your Slack app with the correct event subscriptions and OAuth scopes:

1. Go to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and select your app
2. Under "Features" in the sidebar, click on "Event Subscriptions"
3. Make sure it's enabled and add your Request URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.com/slack/events`)
4. Under "Subscribe to bot events", add these event subscriptions:
   - `message.im` (for direct messages to your bot)
   - `app_mention` (for mentions in channels)
   - `reaction_added` (for monitoring reminder acknowledgments)
5. Then go to "OAuth & Permissions" in the sidebar
6. Under "Scopes", add these Bot Token Scopes:
   - `chat:write` (to send messages)
   - `im:history` (to receive and process direct messages)
   - `im:read` (to access direct message channels)
   - `reactions:read` (to read reminder acknowledgments)
7. Reinstall your app to apply the new permissions

This will allow users to send direct messages to your bot.
